# choose-adventure

My boys wanted to write a choose your own adventure book to help with one of their reading.

This is me making a bit of a start after my eldest fed me a load of material for it.

## Hosting
It's a simple static site at this point, absolutely nothing clever yet.

Something like

```bash
npm install -g serve

serve
```

Then visit on the link it gives you. Or use the SimpleHTTPServer from Python.
